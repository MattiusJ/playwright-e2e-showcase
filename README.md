# playwright-e2e-showcase

Playwright end-to-end test automation showcase

Just a simple Playwright project to showcase some end-to-end testing and frontend verification.

It's easy to build on this and add fixtures, test data driven testing, reporting integration towards systems like Kibana or Grafana, mocking, verify data on external database - and so forth.

I haven't added any of these parts to keep this showcase simple and focused on some of the core Playwright functionality instead.
